## Method Overview

The initial method involved conducting a manual visual analysis of the distributions, which are stored under the `plots` directory. Through this analysis, it was observed that the distribution appeared to be normally distributed. Among the categories, **B** was the most common, followed by **C**, **A**, and lastly **E** and **D**.

The sampling method analyzes the dataset to compute the mean, standard deviation, and probability for each point category. Using these statistics, new data samples are generated to reflect the observed distributions and category probabilities.

# Verifying 
To verify the similarity between the generated data and the original dataset, I conducted a T-test. The results indicated no significant difference between the two, supporting the validity of the sampling method.
